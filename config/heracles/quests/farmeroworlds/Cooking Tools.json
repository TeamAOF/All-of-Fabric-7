      "<br/>",
      "The skillet can be used as a weapon or for cooking, simply shift right click where you wish to place it, it will also require a source of heat and it allows to leave a stack of food in it that will slowly get cooked and then be dropped to the ground just like a campfire",
      "<br/>",
      "<br/>",
      "The cutting board has many recipes and not just for food, it allows using a knife to cut something into something else, to double meats and fish or to obtain slices from the many cakes and pies.",
      "The cutting board also has other recipes that use different tools, like stripping bark of a log with an axe, make sure to check REI for all possibilities",

      "<br/>",
      "Knives can be used to cut things in the cutting board, they can also be used as a weapon although they aren't very strong, however, to obtain ham you will need to kill pigs or hoglins with a knife",
      "Knives can also be made of many materials"
