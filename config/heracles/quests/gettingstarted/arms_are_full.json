      "  I can see you're carrying a bit of weight with you right now. For some reason the backpacks in this world practically alleviate that weight and give you --way-- more room to carry things. The --/b/Traveler's Backpack/b/-- is the most multi-purpose backpack you can create.",

      "  The --/b/Traveler's Backpack/b/-- that you will first craft can store up to 24 spaces. Nine of them can be used together as a crafting space, or merely occupied like the rest. It also has two tanks for holding fluids; these can be pumped to or from of when your pack is placed on the ground. Amazingly, you can also bucket fluids into or out of them while you still wearing the pack.",

      "  The upgraded backpacks increase storage space, tool slots, and tank volume. All tiers include a handy sleeping bag that you can roll out while the pack is set on the grown, provided there is enough space in front of it. Sleep away, if you can, the nightmares that haunt and /4/hunt/4/ in the dark of this world.",
