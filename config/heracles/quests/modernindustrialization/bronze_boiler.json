      "  Steam machines need, well, /b/Steam/b/! The way to get it is to make a /b/Steam Boiler/b/! The /b/Steam Boiler/b/ will gradually consume almost any /6/fuel/6/ you give it to heat up. When it's at a high enough temperature, it will begin to produce /b/Steam/b/ so long as there is /b/Water/b/ in it's /6/internal tank/6/; if not, you'd be wasting fuel.",
      "<br/>",
      "  Or you can put a /b/Water Bucket/b/ into a /b/Furnace/b/ to obtain a /b/Steam Bucket/b/. In this world is seems that fluid containers keep any fluid inside of them, having a persistent temperature and bound to the confined container; so don't worry about it condensing down into water or escaping. With /b/Steam/b/ pre-boiler, you can make a /b/Compressor/b/ to save on /b/Bronze Plates/b/.",
      "<br/>",
      "  It might seem a bit expensive at this current moment, but remember that you can practically triple your ores using the /b/Forge Hammer/b/. Not to mention that in due time, when you have your first two machines, it will become more than twice less expensive than before!",
      "<br/>",
      "  The /b/Boiler/b/ will automatically begin to produce and send the /b/Steam/b/ to adjacent machines or connected pipes, /6/up to 8 millibuckets per tick./6/ ",
      "<br/>",
      "  Bronze machines can only process recipes up to 2 energy unit per tick. You might see it as \"2 EU/t\" when using the machines. 1 millibucket of steam is the same as 1 EU; I for one am really glad it's a very simple conversion cause I'm not a fan of math. Once your /b/Boiler/b/ is at maximum temperature, it can supply 4 machines with /b/Steam/b/ simultaneously! Now --that's-- hot.",
