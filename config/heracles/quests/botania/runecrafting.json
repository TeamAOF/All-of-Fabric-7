      "  Stepping further into the art of floramancy requires harnessing Mana to create **runes**. The Runic Altar, a special table carved from livingrock and adorned with a mana-touched diamond, is capable of doing exactly this.",
      "",
      "  To use, drop the ingredients onto the altar and direct a mana spreader to send to it. When the table has taken in enough mana, sparks will appear, indicating you may now drop a piece of **livingrock** onto it and use your wand on it.",
      "",
      "  The four **elemental runes** all require mana powder, manasteel, and three items associated with their element. Next are the **seasonal runes**, made with two elemental runes, and four additional items representative of their season. Thirdly, the **sin runes**, made with two mana diamonds, and a combination of elemental and seasonal rune. Lastly, the **rune of mana** stands unique, requiring five manasteel ingots and a mana pearl.",
