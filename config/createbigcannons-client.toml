	#How cannon plumes display when a cannon is fired
	#Off - No particles are spawned when firing a cannon. Least laggy option, but it may be harder to detect if a projectile has squibbed in the barrel (no smoke in "pop and no smoke".)
	#Legacy - Cannons spawn vanilla particles (mostly campfire smoke) when firing. The classic look, but spawns many particles and may cause high lag.
	#Default - Cannons spawn cannon smoke particles, designed to give a grand impression while keeping the spawned particle count low compared to Legacy.
